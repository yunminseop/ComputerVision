Main scripts: Sliding Window/ Sobel Filter/ BirdEyeView

perception.py includes cv2 library. I recommend you execute this file in virtual environment including "opencv-python" and **keep it without any dependencies crashes.**
For example, you may have a hard time if you install "labelme" in the virtual environment. It causes crash.
